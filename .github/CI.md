# CI — Win-CodexBar

Win-CodexBar has two deliberately separate hosted CI responsibilities:

- **CircleCI** hosts the primary PR/push validation path: the `pr-check`
  job/workflow in `.circleci/config.yml` runs the full local-check slice on
  CircleCI's hosted Windows executor for every branch pipeline that passes
  its gates.
- The **Blacksmith GitHub Actions** PR check
  (`.github/workflows/pr-check.yml`) is a manual-dispatch-only fallback: its
  `on:` block holds `workflow_dispatch` only, so it no longer schedules
  automatically and is run by hand only for Blacksmith diagnostics.

These responsibilities do not overlap: the CircleCI PR check replaces the
former Blacksmith PR/push gate (see ADR 0005). Its build job has no GitHub
write credential; only the post-approval release publisher receives the
restricted `GH_TOKEN` context.

## CircleCI hosted PR check (primary PR/push gate)

### Workflow — `.circleci/config.yml`

The hosted PR/push validation gate now runs on **CircleCI** as the
`pr-check` job in the `pr-check` workflow (project `nesszer/Win-CodexBar`),
not on Blacksmith. The CircleCI job delegates the whole check to
`scripts/local-check.ps1 -Slice ci`, so the exact commands it runs are:

```powershell
cargo fmt --all --check
cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings
cargo test --workspace
pnpm --dir apps/desktop-tauri test
pnpm --dir apps/desktop-tauri run build
```

Auto-cancel of superseded pushes is a CircleCI **project setting** ("Auto-cancel
redundant workflows", Project Settings → Advanced), not GitHub `concurrency`
YAML — the CircleCI job has none.

### Interaction guard — `.github/workflows/interaction-guard.yml`

The interaction guard remains on `blacksmith-2vcpu-ubuntu-2404` with its
existing `contents: read`, `issues: write`, and `pull-requests: write`
permissions. It is unrelated to release publication.

## GitHub Actions budget mode

Only the interaction guard carries the `if: vars.CI_BUDGET_MODE != 'off'`
gate now; it runs when the variable is unset (`normal`), `normal`, or
`thin`, and skips only when it is `off`. This gate does not disable
CircleCI releases.

Set `CI_BUDGET_MODE` in **Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions →
Variables**. Do not hard-code it in a workflow.

| Mode   | Interaction guard | Circle release |
|--------|-------------------|----------------|
| normal | runs              | tag-triggered  |
| thin   | runs              | tag-triggered  |
| off    | skip              | tag-triggered  |

The Blacksmith Pool minutes intent was roughly **60% Win-CodexBar**,
**30% linear-cli**, and **10% buffer**; that allocation is historical for this
repo — Win-CodexBar no longer draws on the pool. CircleCI credits are separate
and must be budgeted in CircleCI.

## CircleCI release pipeline

Configuration: `.circleci/config.yml`, project **`nesszer/Win-CodexBar`**.
Both jobs use CircleCI's hosted Windows executor (`circleci/windows@5.0`).

1. `release-build` runs only when the workflow tag filter matches exactly
   `^v[0-9]+\.[0-9]+\.[0-9]+$`; branch filters explicitly ignore every branch.
   The preflight rejects PR/branch environment markers as a second boundary.
2. The credential-free build validates the canonical remote, full tag SHA,
   tag-to-SHA identity, protected `main` ancestry, and every project version
   file. It provisions/asserts Node 24.x via the `OpenJS.NodeJS.LTS` winget
   package, pnpm 11.24.0, the Rust MSVC target, Git, and Inno Setup 6.
3. It uses a new temporary `WorkRoot`, runs `release-doctor.ps1`, then runs
   `windows-release-build.ps1` with the immutable SHA and `-SmokeInstall`.
   It never uploads. Six assets — `Quotalis-<version>-Setup.exe` and its
   `.sha256` sidecar, `Quotalis-<version>-portable.zip` and its `.sha256`
   sidecar, `QuotalisCLI-v<version>-windows-x64.zip` and its `.sha256`
   sidecar — plus `release-manifest.json` and build logs are
   persisted to the workspace and stored as CircleCI artifacts.
   The portable ZIP includes the executable, original notification/shortcut
   artwork, licenses and usage guide. Every entry is verified against its source;
   unrelated build-directory files are excluded. It is a no-installer edition,
   not an isolated USB profile. Existing ZIP destinations are never overwritten.
4. `release-approval` is a required manual CircleCI approval job.
5. `release-publish` attaches the workspace and is the only job with context
   `github-release-publisher`. Its `GH_TOKEN` is used by
   `scripts/publish-github-release.ps1` to create or update a **draft** release.
   Exact SHA-256 matches are skipped, mismatches fail, and missing assets are
   uploaded without clobbering. The script never publishes/finalizes a release.

### CircleCI project and context setup

These steps require repository/CircleCI administrator access and are not
automated by this repository:

1. Add the canonical GitHub project `nesszer/Win-CodexBar` to the CircleCI
   organization and enable `.circleci/config.yml`.
2. Create a restricted context named `github-release-publisher`, scoped only to
   this project (and the release job if organization policy supports expression
   restrictions). Add `GH_TOKEN` as a secret; never add it as a project
   variable or to the build job.
3. Use a fine-grained GitHub token for only this repository with **Contents:
   read and write** (release asset API access). Do not grant **Workflows**
   permission; no workflow file is changed by the publisher.
4. Protect the `v*` tag namespace with a GitHub ruleset/tag protection policy
   that permits only authorized release maintainers to create canonical
   `vX.Y.Z` tags. Protect `main` and require the `ci/circleci: pr-check`
   status check.
5. Configure CircleCI notifications and a spending/credit alert appropriate to
   the organization. Do not approve a release until the build artifacts and
   manifest have been reviewed.

The GitHub token is intentionally not available to checkout, preflight,
prerequisite provisioning, release-doctor, build, smoke, or artifact steps.
CircleCI project setup and GitHub tag/context/ruleset changes are the current
manual setup scope.

## Cost, retry, and rollback behavior
CircleCI Windows credits are now the recurring PR cost (spent against the
open-source allowance; see ADR 0005), plus release builds for protected
semver tags and the short approval/publish job. Blacksmith minutes remain
relevant only for the interaction guard and manual-dispatch diagnostics.
Do not use CircleCI for ad-hoc release testing outside its gated triggers.

Reruns are safe: the build is tied to the immutable SHA from the tag and
produces a fresh temporary WorkRoot. If publication stops after some uploads,
rerun the publisher after approval; matching assets are skipped and a same-name
different-hash asset fails rather than being replaced. A final/non-draft release
is never modified by the publisher. Rollback or deletion of a draft/final
release is a deliberate GitHub administrator action, followed by a new tag/SHA
release if replacement is required.

The current smoke scope is `scripts/windows-smoke-install.ps1`: install the
generated Inno Setup installer, verify the expected application/version, then
uninstall it. It does not prove every tray/UI/provider path; those remain
separate Windows/CUA validation work.

## Local release checks

Run the same pure checks and parser-level validation locally:

```powershell
powershell.exe -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts\release-pipeline.tests.ps1
powershell.exe -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts\install-release-prerequisites.ps1 -AssertOnly
```

The hosted release flow is:

```powershell
powershell.exe -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts\release-preflight.ps1 -Tag vX.Y.Z -Sha <full-40-char-sha>
powershell.exe -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts\circleci-release-build.ps1 -Tag vX.Y.Z -Sha <full-40-char-sha>
```

Do not pass an upload switch to `windows-release-build.ps1`; publication is
owned exclusively by the approval-gated, hash-safe publisher.
